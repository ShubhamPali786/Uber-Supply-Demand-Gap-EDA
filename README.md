# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap-EDA
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<b>Business Objectives </b>

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of the problem (i.e. cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. As a result of your analysis, you should be able to present to the client the root cause(s) and possible hypotheses of the problem(s) and recommend ways to improve them.  

<h2>Results Expected </h2>
1. Visually identify the most pressing problems for Uber.<br/>   
    * Hint: Create plots to visualise the frequency of requests that get cancelled or show 'no cars available'; 
    identify the most problematic types of requests (city to airport / airport to city etc.) and the time slots (early mornings, late evenings etc.) using plots <br/>
2. Find out the gap between supply and demand and show the same using plots.<br/>
3. Find the time slots when the highest gap exists. <br/>
4. Find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots <br/>
5. What do you think is the reason for this issue for the supply-demand gap? Write the answer in less than 100 words. You may accompany the write-up with plot(s).
   Recommend some ways to resolve the supply-demand gap.
